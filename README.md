# 🧮 Golden Ratio Face Analyzer

A real-time computer vision application that detects multiple faces via webcam and evaluates their facial symmetry based on the Golden Ratio.

## 📸 Project Overview

This Python-based project uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh technology and OpenCV to track facial landmarks and compute a Golden Ratio-based aesthetic score. It can handle multiple faces at once and dynamically displays each individual's score above their face in the webcam feed.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Real-time facial landmark detection using webcam.
- 👥 Multi-face support with individual scoring.
- 📐 Calculates facial symmetry using the Golden Ratio.
- 🎯 Dynamic overlay of Golden Ratio scores on each detected face.
- 🧠 Mathematical computation based on key facial landmarks.
